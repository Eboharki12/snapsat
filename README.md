**[Snapsat](http://snapsat.org/)** is an opensource webapp that makes it easy to create custom Landsat band composites in a browser.

Why
---

The cost of working with Landsat data is dropping fast due to projects like:
- [Landsat on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/start-using-landsat-on-aws/)
- [Libra](http://libra.developmentseed.org/)
- [developmentseed/landsat-util](https://github.com/developmentseed/landsat-util)
- [Landsat-live](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/landsat-live-live/)

We want to make it even easier.

Recognizing the impact we're having on the Earth is important, and making it easy to access Landsat data seems like a good way to enable others to help tell better stories about ourselves.
