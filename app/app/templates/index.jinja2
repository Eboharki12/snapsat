    <h3>A little background information</h3>
    <h4>What is Landsat?</h4>
    <p>
      Everyday, the Landsat 8 satellite captures nearly 550 scenes of the 
      Earth, each of which measures roughly 180 square kilometers. At worst, 
      it’s an  impressive selfie. At best, it’s a tool for learning about the 
      dynamic processes and characteristics of our planet. If you're just
      getting started with working with Landsat data, or would like to learn
      more, check out
      <a class='bold' href='/guide'>our guide.</a>
    </p>
    <h4>Paths and Rows</h4>
    <p>
      As you pan around, you'll notice that scenes are grouped into sets of listings. Each listing is a unique <em>Path and row</em>, which represents a specific region regularly captured by Landsat. There's a significant amount of overlap between regions, which is why you'll occassionally see multiple groupings.
      <sup><a href='#fn:1' id='fnref:2'>&#8505;</a></sup>
    </p>
    <h4>Scenes</h4>
    <p>
      Within each <em>Path and row</em>, you'll see multiple dates listed. These are referred to as <em>scenes</em>. 
      Because Landsat 8 captures images at the same locations, you can see how the Earth is changing over time.
      <sup><a href='#fn:2' id='fnref:2'>&#8505;</a></sup>
      Typically, scenes with less cloud cover are more useful.
