        <h2 id='basics'>Landsat</h2>
        <p>The Landsat 8 satellite was launched in February 11, 2013, continuing production of a global dataset of first begin in 1972. Each scene it captures measures roughly 180km2, and it captures around 550 scenes of the Earth daily. It's quite an impressive selfie.</p>
        <p>The satellite measure a range of frequencies across the electromagnetic spectrum, a portion of which falls within what we percieve as visible light. That visible portion only accounts for less than half of the light collected by Landsat 8. Which raises the question, what's the purpose of capturing frequencies which we aren't able to see?</p>
        <p>By taking segments of the electromagnetic spectrum and remapping them into one of the red, green, or blue wavelengths we're accustomed to seeing, Landsat gives us a means of visualizing what would otherwise be invisible. In short, Landsat gives us superpowers.</p>

        <h2 id='bands'>Bands</h2>
        <p>Each segment of the electromagnetic spectrum which Landsat 8 measures is called a band, of which there are 11 total.</p>

        <h3>Band 1</h3>
        <p>Landsat 8 is unique in that it is one of the few active satellites which can measure the high-energy blue and violet wavelengths between .435 and .451 nanometers. Those wavelengths have historically been hard to collect, as they're very easily scattered by dust and particulates in the air. Beccause Landsat is able to access them, it gives us a means of visualizing and quantifying the presence of smoke and haze, which can be useful for urban studies. Additionally, because the Ocean and living plants reflect blue's and violet's, Band 1 can be especially useful for measuring the health of the health of the oceans. As such, Band 1 is commonly referred to as the Coastal/Aerosol band.</p>
